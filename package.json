  "readme": "# Test Status Package\n\nAdds the status of your test command to the Atom status bar, when you save a\nsource file.\n\n![Test Status Usage](https://raw.github.com/tombell/test-status/master/screenshots/atom-test-status.gif)\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run\n`apm install test-status` from the command line.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe package will run a test command depending on what files it finds in the root\nof your project. For example, if you have a `Rakefile` in your project root, the\ncommand `rake test` will be run or if you have a `Gruntfile` in your project\nroot then `grunt test` will be run. The priority of which command is executed is\ndetermined by the order the mappings are defined in your configuration.\n\nBy default, the following files are mapped to the commands:\n\n  * `test/*_test.rb` &rarr; `rake test`\n  * `spec/*_spec.rb` &rarr; `rake spec`\n  * `Gruntfile.*` &rarr; `grunt test`\n  * `script/test` &rarr; `script/test`\n  * `script/cibuild` &rarr; `script/cibuild`\n  * `deft-package.json` &rarr; `deft test` (Open Dylan)\n\nWhen your command is running the Hubot face in the status bar will turn orange.\nIf the command exits with 0 the Hubot face will turn green. Exiting with a\nnon-zero code will turn the Hubot face red.\n\nIf you would like to view the output of your command you can toggle the output\npanel using the default keymapping. On Mac OS X the keymap is `cmd-l` and on\nWindows the keymap is `ctrl-l`.\n\nThe following _commands_ are available for you to remap and/or run via the\ncommand palette.\n\n* `test-status:toggle-output` - Toggles the test results output panel\n* `test-status:run-tests` - Runs the configured test command\n\n## Configuring\n\nThe file to command mapping is completely configurable so you can add your\npreferred test runner. Just add the overriden values to your `config.cson`. You\ncan now use glob style matches in the file name.\n\n```coffeescript\n'test-status':\n  'spec/*_spec.rb': 'rake spec'\n  'Gruntfile.*': 'grunt spec'\n  'gulpfile': 'gulp test'\n```\n\nBecause of the way Atom handles the keys of configuration options you should not\ninclude the file extension for the file.\n\n## Gotchyas\n\n* Atom uses `PATH` from where it was launched. Use `atom` from the console for\n  maximum sanity, as Atom from the icon pulls the PATH from whatever launchctl is\n  setup from.\n* When manually configuring file matches containing periods, the Settings view\n  for the package will appear to be broken. This is due to Atom thinking the\n  period is a keypath.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you wish to support this package and help further its development, feel free\nto tip via Gittip.\n\n[![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/tombell.png)](https://www.gittip.com/tombell/)\n",
